I've wanted to start a technical blog for so long... Finally I have one up and running!

Why did it take so long? Well, you know how it goes. First, I have to find a blog platform, preferrably a static site generator hosted on Github pages (Hugo ✔️). Second, I need to figure out a theme. Sixty hours later, I completely forget why I wanted to host a blog in the first place. It's not exactly analysis-paralysis, it's more like a CSS-induced coma.

Yeah.

Props to my friend Sriram for challenging me to get over my irrational styling inertia and consummate things I'm learning by writing about them.

(still, I tinkered with [Fabien's](https://vaga.io/) perfectly suitable m10c theme longer than I should have)

I'm looking forward to putting some thoughts on paper!
